Sure! Let's break down each requirement and how you can meet it as a beginner:

### Functional Requirements

1. **Try playing the game**
   - **Does the game run without crashing?**
     - Ensure your code is free of syntax errors and logical bugs. Test frequently to catch issues early.

2. **Does animation run using `requestAnimationFrame`?**
   - Use `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations. It optimizes rendering performance by syncing with the display refresh rate.

3. **Is the game single player?**
   - Design the game for a single player, focusing on player controls and interactions.

4. **Does the game avoid the use of canvas?**
   - Use DOM elements (like `div`s) for game objects instead of the `<canvas>` element.

5. **Does the game avoid the use of frameworks?**
   - Stick to vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Avoid using libraries or frameworks like React, Angular, or jQuery.

6. **Is the game chosen from the pre-approved list?**
   - Ensure your game concept is from the list of approved games (e.g., Space Invaders).

### Pause Menu

1. **Try pausing the game while it is running**
   - **Does the game display the pause menu, with the options: continue and restart?**
     - Implement a pause menu that appears when the game is paused, with buttons for "Continue" and "Restart".

2. **Try pausing the game while it is running and choose the continue option**
   - **Does the game continue?**
     - Ensure the game resumes from where it left off when "Continue" is selected.

3. **Try pausing the game while it is running and choose the restart option**
   - **Does the game restart?**
     - Ensure the game restarts from the beginning when "Restart" is selected.

### Performance Testing

1. **Use the Dev Tool/Performance to record and try pausing the game while it is running**
   - **Can you confirm there aren't any dropped frames, and `requestAnimationFrame` is able to run at the same rate unaffected?**
     - Use the Performance tab in Dev Tools to check for dropped frames and ensure smooth performance.

### Player Controls

1. **Try moving the player/element using the proper commands and keys to do so**
   - **Does the player obey the commands?**
     - Ensure the player responds correctly to keyboard inputs.

2. **Try moving the player/element using the proper commands and keys to do so**
   - **Does the player move without spamming the key to do so?**
     - Implement smooth and responsive controls without requiring repeated key presses.

### Game Functionality

1. **Try playing the game**
   - **Does the game work like it should (as one of the games from the pre-approved list)?**
     - Ensure the game mechanics and rules match the chosen game concept.

2. **Try playing the game**
   - **Does the countdown/timer clock seem to be working?**
     - Implement and test a countdown or timer if required by the game.

3. **Try playing the game and score some points**
   - **Does the score seem to work like it should, by increasing at a certain action done by the player?**
     - Ensure the score updates correctly based on player actions.

4. **Try playing the game and try losing a life**
   - **Does the player lives seem to work like it should, by decreasing the numbers of lives of the player?**
     - Implement and test the lives system to ensure it decreases correctly when the player loses a life.

### Performance Optimization

1. **Try using the Dev Tool/Performance**
   - **Can you confirm that there are no frame drops?**
     - Use the Performance tab to check for smooth frame rates.

2. **Try using the Dev Tool/Performance**
   - **Does the game run at/or around 60fps? (from 50 to 60 or more)**
     - Ensure the game maintains a frame rate close to 60fps.

3. **Try using the Dev Tool/Performance and the option rendering with the paint ON, if possible**
   - **Can you confirm that the paint is being used as little as possible?**
     - Enable Paint Flashing to check for minimal repainting.

4. **Try using the Dev Tool/Performance and the option rendering with the layer ON, if possible**
   - **Can you confirm that the layers are being used as little as possible?**
     - Check the Layers tab to ensure minimal layer usage.
