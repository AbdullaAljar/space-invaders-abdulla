### Implementing the Games
Each of these games can be implemented using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, adhering to the project's constraints:
- **No frameworks or libraries**: Use vanilla JavaScript.
- **No canvas**: Use DOM elements for rendering.
- **Minimal layers**: Optimize rendering performance.
- **60 FPS**: Ensure smooth and consistent frame rates.
- **Keyboard controls**: Use only keyboard for game controls.
- **Use `requestAnimationFrame`**: For smooth animations.

### Example: Implementing Space Invaders
1. **Set Up Project**: Create `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
2. **Build UI**: Structure the game elements in HTML and style them with CSS.
3. **Game Logic**: Use JavaScript to handle game mechanics, such as player movement, shooting, and enemy behavior.
4. **Performance Optimization**: Use `requestAnimationFrame` for the game loop and optimize rendering.
5. **Testing**: Ensure the game runs smoothly at 60 FPS and controls are responsive.

By following these steps and ensuring you meet the project requirements, you can successfully implement any of these classic games. If you need more detailed guidance on a specific game or further assistance, feel free to ask!
