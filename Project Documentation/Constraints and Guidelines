# Constraints and Guidelines
1. No Frameworks or Libraries:
You must not use any JavaScript frameworks or libraries like React, Vue, Angular, or jQuery. The project should be implemented using plain JavaScript (vanilla JS), HTML, and CSS only.
2. No Canvas Element:
You are not allowed to use the <canvas> element for rendering. All game elements and animations must be handled using the DOM (Document Object Model) and CSS.
3. Minimal Use of Layers:
While you can use layers, their use must be minimal to optimize rendering performance. Overusing layers can lead to performance issues.
4. Consistent 60 FPS:
The game must run at a consistent 60 frames per second (FPS) without frame drops. This means you need to carefully manage performance and avoid any code that could cause jank or stutter.
5. Keyboard Controls Only:
The game must be controlled using the keyboard only. Mouse or touch controls are not allowed. Ensure that the controls are smooth and responsive.
6. Proper Use of requestAnimationFrame:
You must use requestAnimationFrame for animations to ensure smooth and efficient rendering. Avoid using setInterval or setTimeout for animations as they are less efficient.
# Summary of Requirements
1. No frameworks or libraries: Use plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
2. No canvas: Use the DOM for rendering.
3. Minimal layers: Optimize rendering performance.
4. 60 FPS: Ensure smooth and consistent frame rates.
5. Keyboard controls: Use only keyboard for game controls.
6. Use requestAnimationFrame: For smooth animations.
